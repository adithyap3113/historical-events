                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi</a> in March–April 1930. The march
            was the first act in an even-larger campaign of civil disobedience (satyagraha) Gandhi waged against British
            rule in India that extended into early 1931 and garnered Gandhi widespread support among the Indian populace
            and considerable worldwide attention.
            <br>
            Salt production and distribution in India had long been a lucrative monopoly of the British. Through a
            series of laws, the Indian populace was prohibited from producing or selling salt independently, and instead
            Indians were required to buy expensive, heavily taxed salt that often was imported. This affected the great
            majority of Indians, who were poor and could not afford to buy it. Indian protests against the salt tax
            began in the 19th century and remained a major contentious issue throughout the period of British rule of
            the subcontinent. <br><br>

                Salt Satyagraha
            </summary>
            <q>Satyagraha, concept introduced in the early 20th century by Mahatma Gandhi to designate a determined but
                nonviolent resistance to evil. Gandhi’s satyagraha became a major tool in the Indian struggle against
                British imperialism</q> and has since been adopted by protest groups in other countries. <br><br>

            According to this philosophy, satyagrahis—practitioners of satyagraha—achieve correct insight into the real
            nature of an evil situation by observing a nonviolence of the mind, by seeking truth in a spirit of peace
            and love, and by undergoing a rigorous process of self-scrutiny. In so doing, the satyagrahi encounters
            truth in the absolute. By refusing to submit to the wrong or to cooperate with it in any way, the satyagrahi
            asserts that truth. Throughout the confrontation with evil, the satyagrahi must adhere to nonviolence, for
            to employ violence would be to lose correct insight. Satyagrahis always warn their opponents of their
            intentions; satyagraha forbids any tactic suggesting the use of secrecy to one’s advantage. Satyagraha
            includes more than civil disobedience. Its full range of application extends from the details of correct
            daily living to the construction of alternative political and economic institutions. Satyagraha seeks to
            conquer through conversion: in the end, there is neither defeat nor victory but rather a new harmony.
